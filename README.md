# DeSci Reviews: The Capital Markets for Knowledge

**DeSci Reviews is a market-oriented scientific publishing platform that transforms how research is funded, evaluated, and monetized.** We move away from the traditional publication model to create a dynamic ecosystem where knowledge becomes a capital asset, with on-chain liquidity and credibility.

## üö® **The Problem: Traditional Scientific Publishing**

The current scientific publishing system is broken. Authors pay exorbitant fees to publish, reviewers (the backbone of scientific validation) are not compensated, and knowledge remains trapped behind institutional paywalls. The result is a system that expropriates creators' copyright and limits access and liquidity of ideas.

- **Authors Pay:** Costs of $2k to $15k per article
- **Reviewers Unpaid:** Volunteer work is not recognized or rewarded
- **Trapped Knowledge:** Static PDF files, no visibility or liquidity
- **Expropriated Rights:** Publishers hold copyright, not authors

## ‚ú® **The Solution: An Ideas Economy on Solana**

DeSci Reviews reimagines publishing as a listing event in an ideas marketplace. Built on the Solana blockchain, our protocol provides infrastructure to transform intellectual assets into programmable and tradeable assets.

- **Each Journal is a Portfolio:** Curated collections of knowledge assets with market potential
- **Each Article is a Listing Event:** Publishing an article, protocol, or project is like an "IPO of ideas," giving it visibility and a place in the market
- **Each Review is Market Analysis:** Peer reviews become "analyst coverage," providing on-chain credibility and helping the market price the intellectual asset

## üèóÔ∏è **How It Works: On-Chain Architecture**

Our infrastructure uses Solana primitives to create a transparent, efficient, and composable system.

### **Research Assets (pNFTs)**
Each article, protocol, or dataset is minted as a pNFT (programmable Non-Fungible Token) using the Metaplex Core standard. This ensures provenance, enables automatic royalty payments to creators, and provides liquidity to the intellectual asset. Metadata is stored permanently on Arweave via Irys, ensuring immutability.

### **Reviewer Badges (SBTs)**
To build a robust reputation system, we issue Reviewer Badges as Soul-Bound Tokens (SBTs), using the NonTransferable extension of the SPL Token-2022 standard. These badges function as on-chain identity, attesting to each reviewer's specialty and contribution history.

### **Rewards Treasury**
A decentralized treasury manages rewards for reviewers through SOL staking. Reviewers stake SOL to become eligible for rewards, and the treasury automatically distributes payments based on review quality and contributions.
